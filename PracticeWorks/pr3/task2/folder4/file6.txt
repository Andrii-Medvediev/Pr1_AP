The oceans cover more than 70% of the Earth's surface and are home to an incredible diversity of life. They regulate the planet's climate, produce oxygen, and provide food for billions of people. Coral reefs, often referred to as the "rainforests of the sea," are among the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet. Unfortunately, oceans face numerous threats, including pollution, overfishing, and climate change. Efforts to protect marine environments, such as creating marine protected areas, are critical to ensuring their survival. By understanding the importance of oceans, humanity can work towards sustainable solutions for their preservation.
